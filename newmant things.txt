NOTE) (the nynth world section, you did lovely there my bro, but
The pop up wasn’t Nynths First pop up, but soon we’ll have our first pop up,
This was a Pop-up side event, we were the main selling event but the overall main event was the Party” not we that organized, but we also put a bit of tips too, 
So tweak it a bit to say

3) NYNTH WORLD
One of Our Proudest Moments

NYNTH WORLD was a key part of a recent pop-up side event, bringing people together to celebrate creativity and inclusivity. While we weren’t the main event organizers, we played a major role in shaping the experience, adding our own touch to the atmosphere. The event was a testament to our mission: to inspire, connect, and uplift through art and fashion. It also led to a complete sell-out of our Truqha 9 Collection, marking a significant step toward our bigger vision.
